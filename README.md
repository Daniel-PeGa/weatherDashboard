# weatherDashboard

A simple way to check the weather from any device, saving locally the recent searches

## Project Description

This project takes in user input for a city for which the user will be presented with a weather pronostic for the day, as well as the five following days, obtaining information from the openWeather API. It will default to Nashville, the city I've been living for quite some time, but the previous six user searches, and you can just click the button of where it saved and it takes you there immediately.

## Technologies used

* Open weather API
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Moment

## Future development

I'm thinking of making it more appealing to the human eye, perhaps deploy in heroku, but that's about it. I'm thinking this can be useful as a part of a navbar in a future project or just some add-on in a new application

## Install and use

You can easily access the website from the following link:

## How to use the app?

You can just type in the city you're looking for the weather for and check it out. Otherwise, enjoy showering in the knowledge of Nashville's random weather!
